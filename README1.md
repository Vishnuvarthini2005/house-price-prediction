# 🏠 House Price Prediction (AI Project)

This project uses **Linear Regression** to predict house prices based on features like number of rooms (`rm`) and percentage of lower-status population (`lstat`).

### 📚 Steps:
1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Visualize relationships using Seaborn
3. Train a Linear Regression model
4. Evaluate with MSE and R²
5. Visualize Actual vs Predicted prices

### 🧠 Tech Stack:
- Python
- Pandas, Numpy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

### 📈 Result:
The model predicts housing prices with good accuracy and shows a positive correlation between number of rooms and price.
